# DLoRA-EMNLP24 Findings(to be appeared)
The code will consist of two parts:
1. Host-side scripts
2. Device-side scripts -- (under construction)
# Overall Assumptions
We are assuming the LoRA modules are stored on the device side while the backbone model is on the host side, as in the following architecture![figure](Figures/Assumption.jpg) depicts.
# Install Dependency

# Bash Scripts
